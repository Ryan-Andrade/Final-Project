# Final-Project

## Price Direction Prediction
The idea behind this project is to prediction the price direction of 10 energy stocks.  

## Current Task
Everyone is creating their own Branches and will be dropping the last column and filtering for the start of 2021. Then creating summary statistics and a visualization to help further understand. 

## Ideas
We should consider encoding the dates as 0-252 (there are 253 trading days in the year).
There may be some similarities on specific days each year that the algorithm may be able to detect patterns within.

In order to add volume as a learning metric to our algorithm we would need the data listed here: https://firstratedata.com/i/stock/CMS
